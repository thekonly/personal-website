    <p>I have a passion for technology and excellent customer service skills, which I developed by working for top organizations such as Algar Brazil, Bags Inc at Walt Disney World and Apple Inc. I am also multilingual with verbal and written fluency in English and Brazilian Portuguese and conversational Spanish. My goal is to apply my skills and knowledge at an organisation that values critical thinking, problem solving and job dedication.&nbsp;
